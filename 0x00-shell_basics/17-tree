# Create a script that creates the directories welcome/, welcome/to/ and welcome/to/holberton in the current directory.
# You are only allowed to use two spaces (and lines) in your script, not more.

mkdir {./welcome/,./welcome/to/,./welcome/to/holberton} #There was an easier way to do this... mkdir -p welcome/to/holberton
